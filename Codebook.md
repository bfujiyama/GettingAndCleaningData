#Codebook for tidy dataset

##Source
This dataset is based on collection by wearable technology. More information is available here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

##Feature Selection
The README in the dataset explains how the data was collected and arranged. 

The set of variables that were estimated and kept for this assignment from the original signals are:  
+ mean(): Mean value  
+ std(): Standard deviation

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:  

+ gravityMean  
+ tBodyAccMean  
+ tBodyAccJerkMean  
+ tBodyGyroMean  
+ tBodyGyroJerkMean  

Other estimates have been removed for the purpose of this excercise.
